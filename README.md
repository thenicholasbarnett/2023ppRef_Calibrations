This repository includes executable .C scripts, header and text files, as well as this readme. 

The text files are the MC truth corrections for jet energies of the 2023 ppRef run. One folder of L2L3 files is for PbPb reconstruction, and the other is for pp reconstruction, but both are for an MC ppRef dataset generated by Dr. Austin Baty.

The current executable codes are for generating the pt balance R values, and the ratio of those R values for MC and Data. The current R value executables in this repository are setup to run through condor, and the ratio is setup to run locally.

The DATA used was from the 2023 ppRef run's zero bias dataset.
