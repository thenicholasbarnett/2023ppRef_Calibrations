This repository includes a script, some txt files, and this readme. 
This script is to apply L2L3 corrections to the 2023 ppRef run in CMS last october. 
There are txt files present for the L2L3 corections for jet energies. One folder of L2L3 files is for PbPb reconstruction, and the other is for pp reconstruction, but both are for an MC ppRef dataset generated by Dr. Austin Baty.

All of the dataset for the Data ppRef run in 2023 is forested in the path below.
